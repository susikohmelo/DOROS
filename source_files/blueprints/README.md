# Prototpyed functions in C for reasier conversion into ASM

Writing more sophisticated functions in assembly is hard.
So I'm writing a blueprint in C, then converting it to assembly by hand.

This may also be an easier to digest form of documentation for .asm.
If you're confused about the logic of any of the assembly - try
